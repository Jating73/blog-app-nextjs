## ðŸš¨ The Problem

Many macOS users face this issue: typing

```bash
code .
```

in the terminal doesnâ€™t open Visual Studio Code. Instead, you may get an error like:

```bash
zsh: command not found: code
```

This happens because the ==code== command is not added to your system PATH.

## âœ… The Solution

Follow these steps to fix it:

1. **Open VS Code**  
   Launch Visual Studio Code on your Mac.

2. **Open the Command Palette**  
   Press ==Cmd + Shift + P== to open the command palette.  
   Search for:  
   Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH  
   Click on it to install the ==code== command globally.

3. **Restart Your Terminal**  
   Close and reopen your terminal (iTerm, Terminal, or Warp).  
   Now type:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

   It should open the current folder in VS Code.

## ðŸ”§ If It Still Doesnâ€™t Work

If the above doesnâ€™t solve it, you may need to add the VS Code binary to your PATH manually:

- Make sure you drag the Visual Studio Code application into the Applications folder
  Otherwise, you'll have to go through the above process again after a reboot.
